The impact of these ride-hailing services likely varies across traveler segments that differ in their usage of various modes of transportation. In this paper, we develop and leverage a framework that allows us to examine the impact of ride-hailing services on the transportation mode choice for three traveler segments: drivers (who primarily use a personal automobile to travel), riders (who primarily use public transit to travel), and walkers (who primarily use non-motorized modes of transport). We first develop a framework outlining how the behavior of different traveler segments would be impacted by the introduction of ride-hailing services and show how this affects traffic congestion and public transportation ridership. To test the framework, we compiled a rich dataset, combining data on public transportation ridership, traffic congestion, and individual transportation mode choice. Employing a difference-in-differences methodology, we show that the Uber entry in a market enabled those who were walkers and riders prior to the entry of Uber to travel more conveniently, leading to an increase in traffic congestion, and induced those who were drivers to substitute their use of private automobiles with a combination of Uber and public transit. We introduced urban compactness to assess the heterogeneous impact of ride-hailing services for cities that differ in their distribution of traveler segments. We found that Uber entry increases traffic congestion and reduces public transit demand more in cities with higher levels of urban compactness, i.e., where the proportion of riders and walkers is higher than that of drivers. This work provides a holistic framework to understand the mechanism underlying the impact of ride-hailing services on public transit and traffic congestion. Urban planners and policy makers can leverage our framework, methodology, and empirical results to guide city planning decisions that have implications for sustainability.","tags":["social infrastructure"],"title":"Impact of Ride-Hailing Services on Transportation Mode Choices: Evidence from Traffic and Transit Ridership","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663891200,"objectID":"40251364eb14736e425122d90e784ddf","permalink":"https://khlee42.github.io/post/wise2022/","publishdate":"2022-09-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/wise2022/","section":"post","summary":"\"Equalizing access: The effects of ride-sourcing technology on spatial inequality\" has been accepted for presentation at WISE 2022 üëã","tags":["social infrastructure"],"title":"WISE 2022","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1659830400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659830400,"objectID":"62532092d7ba38d8eb3f587d8f250d62","permalink":"https://khlee42.github.io/post/cist2022/","publishdate":"2022-08-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/cist2022/","section":"post","summary":"\"Pay Me in Crypto?

This study aimed to investigate how the usage patterns of mHealth app functions affect user retention. We collected individual usage logs for 1,439 users of single tethered personal health record app, which spanned an 18-months period from August 2011 to January 2013. The user logs contained timestamps whenever an individual uses each function, which enables us to identify the usage patterns based on the intensity of using a particular function in the app. We then estimated how these patterns were related to 1) the app usage over time (using the random effect model) and 2) the probability of stopping the use of the application (using the Cox proportional hazard model). The analyses suggested that the users utilize the app most at the time of the adoption and gradually reduce their usage over time. The average duration of use after starting the app was 25.62 weeks (SD: 18.41). The degree of the usage reduction, however, decreases as the self-monitoring function is more frequently used (coefficient = 0.002, P = 0.013); none of the other functions has this effect. Moreover, engaging with the self-monitoring function frequently (coefficient = ‚àí0.18, P = 0.003) and regularly (coefficient = 0.10, P = 0.001) significantly also reduces the probability of abandoning the application. Specifically, the estimated survival rate indicates that, after 40 weeks since the adoption, the probability of the regular users of self-monitoring to stay in use was about 80% while that of non-user was about 60%. This study provides the empirical evidence that sustained use of mHealth app is closely linked to the regular usage on self-monitoring function. The implications can be extended to the education of users and physicians to produce better outcomes as well as application development for effective user interfaces.","tags":["digital platforms"],"title":"Effect of self-monitoring on long-term patient engagement with mobile health applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kyunghee Lee","Byungtae Lee","Wonseok Oh"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643042924,"objectID":"94c781a318e6f8cba29a0351a7ce9272","permalink":"https://khlee42.github.io/publication/lee-2015-ek/","publishdate":"2022-01-24T16:48:44.831241Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lee-2015-ek/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study we investigate whether social reference systems, such as Facebook ``likes'' (FBLs), promote sales in social commerce, wherein adverse selection and quality uncertainty often severely damage consumer trust and impede efforts to achieve sustainable growth. We also examine the extent to which product characteristics (product uncertainty and product franchising) and deal characteristics (tipping points, discount rates, and deal durations) moderate the social selling stimulated by FBLs. On the basis of 1,327 samples collected from a major social commerce platform provider, we identify several interesting empirical regularities regarding the relationship between FBLs and social commerce sales. The findings suggest that FBLs drive traffic and increase sales. Information technology artifacts and social technologies, such as FBLs, can endow a consumers shopping experience with a socialization component and induce social selling in collective buying platforms. Nevertheless, significant variations occur across products and deals. For example, consumers who purchase experience goods more frequently depend on FBLs than do those who buy search goods. FBLs exert a far greater influence on the sales of goods from independent stores than those from franchise chains. Social commerce consumers are unaffected by heavy discount rates as they make purchase decisions, but they extensively rely on FBLs, particularly when purchasing products that have low tipping points. Our results suggest that social commerce can be a powerful marketplace when the economic utility that is driven by price incentives is further strengthened and protected by the social utility that originates from trust and sharing.","tags":["digital platforms"],"title":"Thumbs up, sales up?
